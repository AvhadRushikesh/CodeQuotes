Treat others as you would like them to treat you.
Be brave take risks Nothing can substitute experience.
Stop living in Past.
Stop putting yourself down.

Mistakes increases experience, Experience decreases mistakes, If you learn from your mistakes then other learn from your success.
Stop making excuses.
Stop doing same thing again and again and expecting different output.
One day you will look back and realise that you worried too much about things that don't really matter.
Don't be the Same be Better.
Never Give Up.
A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor.
The best way to predict the future is to create it.
